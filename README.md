### exercises
In exercises are a selection of easy and medium problems you can try to solve using C++. There is built in testing for
each problem, simply read the instructions in HOW_TO_TEST.md located in exercises.

### git
In the git directory you will find "try it out", which is a simple exercise to get you familiar with the git workflow.
See if you can follow the steps to make a pull request to this repository!

### group_projects
In group_projects you will find the template for the group project. 
This section is currently under construction, but will be where you will be submitting your group project.

### testing
Testing is the directory where tests are stored.
You can peek at the tests if you want to see how they work, but you should not need to modify them.
